I am a passionate worker who loves to build things that ship. I write clean, readable code, and build clean, readable websites. When it comes to development and design, I pay very close attention to the little things. Here are some other reasons I would be a great employee for Next Glass:

<ul>
    <li>I have a passion for making things. I have over 17 personal projects under my belt in the last 2 years alone.</li>
    <li>I have experience in the industry, having interned at HeadCode in San Francisco</li>
    <li>I am a fast, yet thorough learner, having projects in C++, C, PHP, NodeJS, JavaScript, HTML, and Python.</li>
    <li>I am familiar with design patterns, and I am able to implement functionality in common APIs such as AngularJS and JQuery from scratch, so as to better fit the job at hand if necessary. And yet I understand the value of reusing code.</li>
    <li>I have extensive knowledge of theoretical computer science, and I am able to assess the time and space complexity of an algorithm to write the best code for the job at hand.</li>
</ul>
